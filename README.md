Official Pytorch Implementation for y-Aware Contrastive Learning [submitted to MICCAI 2021]


## Pre-training your own model
First, you can clone this repository with:
"""
git clone https://github.com/Duplums/yAwareContrastiveLearning.git
"""

Then you can directly run the main script with your configuration including:
- the paths to your training/validation data
- the proxy label you want to use during training along with the hyperparameter sigma


## Fine-tuning your model
